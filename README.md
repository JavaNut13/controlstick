# Controlstick

Emulates keyboard and mouse input from a controller, allowing you to play games with little or no controller support.

+ Custom control schemes
+ Adjust sensitivity
+ Wireless - Works over bluetooth
+ Invertable axes

Controlstick uses [JInput](https://java.net/projects/jinput), a multiplatform API for interfacing with game controllers and joysticks. Controlstick adds a powerful and flexible interface on top of JInput which lets you change the behaviour of each individual button and axis on your controller.

### Testing

Controlstick has been tested with an official and an unofficial DualShock 3 controller with the following games on a 2010 MacBook Pro.

+ Assassin's Creed
+ Half Life
+ Minecraft
+ Portal

The only game so far to fail is the Stanley Parable, which is disappointing. :'(
